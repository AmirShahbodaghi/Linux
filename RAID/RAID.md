RAID is used for:

Data redundancy: Protecting against disk failures.
Performance improvement: Increasing read/write speeds.
Larger storage capacity: Combining multiple drives.

Types of RAID
RAID can be classified into Software RAID (managed by OS) and Hardware RAID (managed by a RAID controller). Here are the common RAID levels:

RAID 0 (Striping) - Performance Boost
✅ Pros:

High read/write performance.
Full disk space utilization.
❌ Cons:

No redundancy (if one disk fails, all data is lost).
📌 How it works: Data is split (striped) across multiple disks. 📌 Use case: High-speed applications (e.g., video editing, gaming).

RAID 1 (Mirroring) - Data Redundancy
✅ Pros:

Data is duplicated (mirrored) across disks.
High fault tolerance (if one disk fails, data is safe).
❌ Cons:

50% storage loss (since data is duplicated).
Slower write speeds.
📌 Use case: Critical systems (e.g., databases, financial records).

RAID 5 (Striping + Parity) - Balanced Performance & Redundancy
✅ Pros:

Redundancy using parity (can recover from 1 disk failure).
Good performance.
❌ Cons:

Slower write performance (parity calculation overhead).
Requires at least 3 disks.
📌 Use case: General-purpose servers.

RAID 6 (Striping + Double Parity) - Higher Fault Tolerance
✅ Pros:

Can withstand 2 disk failures.
Good read performance.
❌ Cons:

Slower writes (double parity calculation).
Requires at least 4 disks.
📌 Use case: Enterprise storage, critical databases.

RAID 10 (RAID 1 + RAID 0) - Best of Both Worlds
✅ Pros:

High performance (striping).
High redundancy (mirroring).
❌ Cons:

Expensive (requires at least 4 disks).
Only 50% usable space.
📌 Use case: High-performance databases, virtualization.
